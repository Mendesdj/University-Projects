# Human Computer Interaction

This was a project made in groups of 3 students. We had almost full liberty on choosing the theme of the project and the platform it was built on.
We did a paper-only testing phase and ended up building a functional computational prototype.

This was the first Native Android Application any of us built. The code isn't exactly the best it could be but considering the time constraints and our inexperience with the platform, I was fairly happy with the result.
Interface wise it could use some improvements.

##Problem Description:
We aimed to build an application that is based on showing the users culinary recipes so they can recreate them. The problem we see on today’s applications that aim to do the previous is that the users tend to waste a lot of time at looking at recipes to which they don’t have the ingredients to reproduce. The fact that the user realizes that, after opening and checking the ingredients of the recipe he was looking eager to do, is both time consuming and discouraging. We intended to tackle this problem in an intuitive and efficient manner.

##Project Goal:
Our goal was to create an Android application, that made use of a stock management tool to display to the users the recipes they can actually make. Besides that, we thrived to automate the process of introducing items to the inventory by simulating that shopping receipts have QR Codes regarding the products bought on that purchase, this allowed us to update the inventory without manually selecting each ingredient we added to our stock.
