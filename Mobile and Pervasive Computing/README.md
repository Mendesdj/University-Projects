# Mobile and Pervasive Computing

This course project, made in groups of three students meant to tackle and give an understanding of the issues and capabilites of modern mobile and pervasive computing.

## Project Description

The project consisted in devoloping a system capable of controlling the access to a room. The system allowed users to open and close a door on premises by presenting their student card to a RFID card reader, or remotely by using the Android App.
The system registered and managed all entries of users.
The system's operation scheme and hardware used is described in more detail in the Report.pdf (in Portuguese :( )
