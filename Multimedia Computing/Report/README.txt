The project was built using the 0.9.8 open frameworks release and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015

The addons used were 
	ofxCv-stable
	ofxOpenCv
	ofxXmlSettings
	ofxDatGui-master (it is important to replace this addon because we applied some changes to the source code of the addon to fit our needs)
	
We created the directory structure so it is easier to compile and run the program.

The Class Diagram is divided 
	The "ClassDiagram detailed" contains all the methods and variables with no relations betweeen them
	The "ClassDiagramRelations" contains only the relations
	
We divided them as it seemed easier to analyse.

Videos for testing are included in the bin/data/Movies folder
Input images for keypoint detection are also included in the bin/data/QueryImages folder
